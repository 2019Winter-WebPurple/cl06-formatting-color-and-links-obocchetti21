        Summer is the best season for a ton of reasons.
      </p>  
  
    <p>       
    Summer is the best season because it is warm, and most of the time sunny. During summer there is no school, so there is not much to worry about. Another reason is becuase this is a good time to go on Vacation, see family and friends, and most of all go to the beach.
